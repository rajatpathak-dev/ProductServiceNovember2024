## High-Level Design (HLD)

### Architecture Components
- **Load Balancers (LB)**: Distribute traffic across servers for high availability (e.g., AWS ELB).
- **API Gateway**: Entry point for routing requests, managing rate limits, and handling authentication (e.g., Kong).
- **Microservices**: Separate services for modular and scalable architecture.
- **Databases**: MySQL and MongoDB for structured and unstructured data.
- **Message Broker (Kafka)**: Enable asynchronous inter-service communication.
- **Caching (Redis)**: Boost response times for frequently accessed data.
- **Search & Analytics (Elasticsearch)**: Efficient product searches with advanced capabilities.

---

## Typical Flow

### Part 1: Product Search
1. User logs in and searches for a product.
2. Request passes through the Load Balancer to the API Gateway.
3. API Gateway routes the search request to the Product Catalog Service.
4. Product Catalog Service queries Elasticsearch for results.

### Part 2: Add to Cart
1. User adds a product to the cart.
2. Cart Service stores the item in MongoDB and produces a Kafka message.

### Part 3: Checkout
1. User checks out.
2. Order Management Service processes the order and sends a Kafka message.
3. Payment Service consumes the message to handle payment.
