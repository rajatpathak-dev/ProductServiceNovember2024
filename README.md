## High-Level Design (HLD)

### Architecture Components
- **Load Balancers (LB)**: Distribute traffic across servers for high availability (e.g., AWS ELB).
- **API Gateway**: Entry point for routing requests, managing rate limits, and handling authentication (e.g., Kong).
- **Microservices**: Separate services for modular and scalable architecture.
- **Databases**: MySQL and MongoDB for structured and unstructured data.
- **Message Broker (Kafka)**: Enable asynchronous inter-service communication.
- **Caching (Redis)**: Boost response times for frequently accessed data.
- **Search & Analytics (Elasticsearch)**: Efficient product searches with advanced capabilities.

### Microservices
#### 1. User Management Service
- Functions: Handles user registration, login, profile management, and password resets.
- Database: MySQL for structured user data.
- Kafka: Produces events (e.g., user registration) for notifications and other services.

#### 2. Product Catalog Service
- Functions: Manages product details, categories, and search.
- Database: MySQL for structured product data.
- Search: Elasticsearch for full-text and typo-tolerant searches.

#### 3. Cart Service
- Functions: Manages shopping carts.
- Database: MongoDB for flexibility in data structure.
- Caching: Redis for fast cart retrieval.

#### 4. Order Management Service
- Functions: Handles order creation, history, and tracking.
- Database: MySQL.
- Integration: Communicates with Payment Service and User Management Service using Kafka.

#### 5. Payment Service
- Functions: Processes payments and manages transaction logs.
- Database: MySQL.
- Kafka: Produces payment confirmation events consumed by the Order Management Service.

#### 6. Notification Service
- Functions: Sends emails/SMS notifications (e.g., registration confirmation, order updates).
- Integration: Consumes Kafka events and integrates with Amazon SES for email delivery.

## Database
- **MySQL**: For structured data such as users, products, and orders.
- **MongoDB**: For flexible, unstructured data like user carts.

---

## Message Broker (Kafka)
- Ensures asynchronous communication between microservices.
- Provides data consistency and event store functionality.

---

## Caching (Redis)
- Used primarily by the Cart Service for faster data retrieval and response times.

---

## Search and Analytics (Elasticsearch)
- Facilitates fast and typo-tolerant product searches.

---

## Typical Flow

### Part 1: Product Search
1. User logs in and searches for a product.
2. Request passes through the Load Balancer to the API Gateway.
3. API Gateway routes the search request to the Product Catalog Service.
4. Product Catalog Service queries Elasticsearch for results.

### Part 2: Add to Cart
1. User adds a product to the cart.
2. Cart Service stores the item in MongoDB and produces a Kafka message.

### Part 3: Checkout
1. User checks out.
2. Order Management Service processes the order and sends a Kafka message.
3. Payment Service consumes the message to handle payment.
